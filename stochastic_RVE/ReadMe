This code is to generate mesh file for the two-dimensional microscale RVE written in C++
The RVE is composed with circle fiber inclusions and soft matrix. 
The position of circle inclusions are randomly distributed, which is the major uncertainty in multiscale problem coming from.
To run the code, use script "./run input"
